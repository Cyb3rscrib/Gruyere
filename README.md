# Gruyere Security Assessment Report

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed security assessment of the Google Gruyere web application. It identifies several vulnerabilities, along with proofs of concept and recommended mitigations. The assessment is aimed at highlighting potential security risks and providing guidance on how to address them to improve the application's security posture.

## Vulnerabilities Overview

### VULN-010: Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI)
- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Description:** Allows inclusion of untrusted JavaScript, leading to potential data theft or XSS attacks.
- **Mitigations:** Implement CSRF tokens, restrict JSON responses to POST requests, and validate Origin and Referrer headers.

### VULN-011: Path Traversal
- **Risk Level:** High
- **Description:** Enables attackers to access sensitive files on the server by manipulating file paths.
- **Mitigations:** Store sensitive files outside the document root, implement strict input validation, and restrict directory access.

### VULN-012: Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Risk Level:** High
- **Description:** Allows server shutdown and overloading by manipulating specific endpoints and files.
- **Mitigations:** Implement access controls, monitor server requests, and limit the impact of infinite loops.

### VULN-013: Code Execution
- **Risk Level:** Critical
- **Description:** Allows arbitrary code execution by exploiting Path Traversal and DoS vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigations:** Sanitize file uploads, address path traversal vulnerabilities, and enforce least privilege principles.

### VULN-014: Information Disclosure
- **Risk Level:** High
- **Description:** Exposes clear-text usernames and passwords through inadequate access controls.
- **Mitigations:** Restrict sensitive file access, hash and encrypt passwords, and enhance file upload security.

### VULN-015: Insecure JavaScript Code Implementation
- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Description:** Enables injection of malicious JavaScript, creating phishing links.
- **Mitigations:** Implement input sanitization, use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, and conduct thorough code reviews.

## Proof of Concept

Each vulnerability is accompanied by a proof of concept that demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited. These proofs of concept are provided for educational and testing purposes only.

## Recommended Mitigations

For each identified vulnerability, specific mitigation strategies are outlined to address and resolve the security issues. Implementing these recommendations will help enhance the overall security of the application.

## Conclusion

The Gruyere web application contains several critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. It is essential to apply the recommended mitigations to address these issues and improve the security of the application.
